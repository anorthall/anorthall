### Hello! 
I'm Andrew. I'm an amateur programmer, seeking to improve my skills through project based learning.  

I'm currently working on:

- My personal website [northall.me.uk](https://northall.me.uk/) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/anorthall/northall.me.uk)
- Making my way through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Tinkering with my home server

#### Personal Repo
I will store some basic one file scripts and perhaps TODO lists/project ideas in this repo. None of them are really
intended for use by anyone else, but please feel free to look/comment.
